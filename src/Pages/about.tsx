        Hey! I'm a <strong>Full-Stack Developer</strong> who enjoys turning ideas into reality with clean, scalable code.
        I specialize in building dynamic front-end experiences with React, and robust back-end systems using Node.js and MongoDB.
        <br /><br />
        My journey started with a love for creating things â€” from simple static websites to full-stack applications.
        Iâ€™m currently focused on building responsive web apps and continually learning modern frameworks.
        <br /><br />
        When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m probably gaming, exploring tech news, or learning Japanese ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ.
      </Typography>
    </Box>
